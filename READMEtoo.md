Hello and Welcome to my 
"READMEtoo" document  , 
I hope you enjoy and will contribute freely and responsibly ! 

im asking for a manual on stuff , 
and a Q and A section for hangups ! thanks !  


This is simply a document where I will push and pull various questions to expand my knowledge. 
I have found it useful during this process to document
and create , 
two specific things while engaging in the material , 
To really supplement hands on experience in small to large scale.  

2 main things have been helpful

#1. A small Manual of straight definitions.
A straight and direct "websters dictionary " , definition style set of documents for HTML, CSS, and others , ( like the flexbox manual on css styles for example, or sql / sass because I am still completely new on it,  --- (I have some HTML and CSS  ---- but  sass and sql manual for definitions would be awesome! ; -).   ---- . 

#2. 
Q & A  and FAQ 
being able to ask and answer a lot of main questions that may come in my way or that may come in others way in achieving a task.  theresore , In various specifics , I will use this 
"READMEtoo" file , as a database for  organizing and displaying often referred too and quality 
Q & A and General FAQ ,  For all of Code Louisville to use and reference as well.  But for the now just us.
